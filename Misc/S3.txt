S3 101

Simple storage service

	object based storage - for flat files/pics/vids etc.
	if you want to store OS etc, use block based storage
	0-5 TB size of objectS3 is universal namepage. unique globally.
	on successful upload get a 200 status code
	data spread across multiple devices and regions
	pay per gig
	data stored in a bucket which is essentially a folder.
	bucket name is unique globally http://domainname.com/<bucketName>
	
	Data consistency model - exam topic
		read after write PUTS for new object - available immediately
		Eventual consistency for updates/deletes - available eventually , say milli secs.
	
	The S3 object contsists of the following	
		Key (name of the object) 
		value (data)
		versiond ID
		metadata
		sub resrouce
			Access Control List
			bucket policy
			Torrent
		
	bulit for 99.99 availability. amazon guarantees 99.9 availability, 99.9999(11 9s) for durability.

	Tierd storage- class based storage
	lifecycle management - for older data we can set policy to move from one storage to another.
	versioning
	Encryption
	Bucket policy for a bucket
	ACL for individual file
	
	
	Storage classes
		S3 standard
			multiple devices, zones
			designed to sustain  loss of 2 facilities
			99.99 % availability, 11 9s durability.
		S3 -IA (Infrequent access)
			multiple devices, zones
			lower storage fee, but data retrieval charge
		S3 one zone -IA (Reduced Redundancy)
			one zone storage, no data resilience. even lower fee.
		
		Glacier 
			Archival only. cheapest storage.no SLA given for service level
			
			Expedited data  - retrieval time. restored in few min
			Standard	3-5 hour
			Bulk		5-12 hour
	
	Charging policy
		storage per gig
		requests
		storage management policy - for tagging (metadata)
		data transfer pricing - cross region.
		Transfer acceleration - transfer data faster over long distances. It internally uses the amazon cloud front services.
		
	user uploads to an edge location. Edge location transfers the data to all the regions(Edge locations) ?.
	
	Exam tips:-
	objects inside the S3 not install an OS
	HTTP 200 for success retrieval.
	
	READ THE S3 FAQ before going for exam. It coems up a lot.
	
Cloud Front (CDN)
-----------

	content delivery network
	Edge Location - location where content is cached
	Origin - origin of file where the file is originally located., route 53, S3 bucket , user servers.
	Distribution 
	
	Web distribution - for websites
	RTMP - media streaming - eg. flash based.
	
Exam tips
	 same as above
	 Edge location not for read only. You can put a file on Edge location. 
	 TTL time to live is defined. You can clear cache objects but you will be charged.
	 
	 
S3 security & Encryption
------------------------

	All new created buckets are private.
	Set up access using
		bucket policy
		ACL
	S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs  which will log all access requests. This can be done to another bucket and can also be done to another account.
	
	Encryption
	----------
	In transit
		using SSL/TLS
	
	Data at rest
		server side encryption- S3 managed keys.  SSE-S3
											data encrypted. key also encrypted using master key.
											256 bit encryption
								AWS Key management Service - managed keys SSE-KMS
											additional charge.
											envelop key- for data protection key
											audit trail of when/ who used the keys.
											option to create managed encryption key.
								Server side encryption with Customer provided Keys - SSE-C
		Client Side Encryption
	
								
 
 Storage Gateway (popular exam topic)
 ---------------
 Service that connects on premise software with cloud based storage.
 on Prem DC to aws storage replication. (say oly for storage purposes) 
 download image on your prem. InstalAssociate with your account.
 
 4 types
		File gateway (NFS )- using NFS. store Flat file/pics/vids in S3.
		Volumes Gateway - iSCSI- store block files. so can be used for OS replication . VM ware running on this.
				2types
				stored volumes - entire copy of data
				cached volumes- recently accessed data
				
		Tapes gateway- VTL

	File gateway (not likely to appear in exam) .
